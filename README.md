# City Portal

**City Portal** is an augmented reality (AR) application developed using SwiftUI and RealityKit for Apple Vision Pro. The app provides an interactive experience where users can explore different virtual worlds through portals, seamlessly integrated into a 3D environment. Each world is represented by a skybox, and users can interact with the scene by dragging a 3D box entity within the environment.


### Features

- **Interactive 3D Box**: Users can drag a 3D box within the AR scene, demonstrating interactive entity manipulation.
- **Multiple Virtual Worlds**: Explore four distinct virtual worlds through portals.
- **Dynamic Portals**: Portals are dynamically created and rotated based on the user's interaction.
